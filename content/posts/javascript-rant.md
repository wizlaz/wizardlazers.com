```javascript
[] + [] // ""
[] + {} // "[object Object]"
{} + [] // 0
{} + {} // NaN
```

If you look at these examples and think "this makes perfect sense," you're part of the problem. JavaScript isn't a programming language - it's a practical joke that got out of hand.

"But what about TypeScript?" Oh, you mean JavaScript with a safety helmet and knee pads? How brave of you to admit you can't handle dynamic typing.

The only reason JavaScript is successful is because we're all Stockholm Syndrome victims trapped in browser-based development. Change my mind (you can't).

P.S. Node.js is just PHP for hipsters. There, I said it.
