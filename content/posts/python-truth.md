Oh, you think Python is a "real" programming language? That's cute. Let me explain why you're wrong:

1. Significant whitespace? Really? We're basing program structure on *spaces*? What's next, determining variable scope by font size?

2. "But it's so readable!" Yeah, so is "See Spot Run," but I wouldn't use it to build enterprise software.

3. The GIL is basically Python admitting it can't handle real concurrent programming.

Look, I get it. Some people need their hand held through programming concepts. That's fine! Just don't pretend you're doing "serious development" when you're basically writing glorified shell scripts.

P.S. Yes, I know about Django and NumPy. No, they don't change my mind.
