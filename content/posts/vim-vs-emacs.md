Let's be honest - if you're using VSCode, you're basically admitting you need training wheels for coding. Real developers use Vim or Emacs (but mostly Vim, because Emacs is just an operating system pretending to be a text editor).

Don't @ me with your "but it has so many extensions!" Yeah, extensions to help you feel better about not knowing how to exit Vim. I've been coding since before IntelliSense was a thing, and let me tell you, auto-completion is making developers lazy.

And don't even get me started on people who use Sublime Text. That's like bringing a plastic spork to a sword fight.

Fight me in the comments if you disagree (you know you want to).
